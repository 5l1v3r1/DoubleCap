# DoubleCap
A prototype for a double cap for secure water sample collection with a confined bioreporter.

AIM : <br>
• Assuring secure samples collection in the field <br>
• Keeping the GMO reporter bacteria from being released into the environment <br>
• No extra wastes produced <br>


IDEA : <br>
• A double cap to connect the water sample one side and the bioreporter on the other side <br>
• An aluminum seal coverts the bioreporter vial to prevent GMO outflow <br>
• The seal is pierced by a connector between the two caps after starting screwing <br>


WORKFLOW OF THE DOUBLE CAP : <br>
1) The bioreporter is prepared in the lab and the vial is sealed. Then the vial is closed by a cap for the transport. <br>
2) Water is collected with a second vial <br>
3) The double cap is screwed on the water collection vial (side without connector) <br>
4) After removing the cap, the bioreporter vial is screwed to the other side (with connector) <br>
5) The two substances are mixed, the two vials stays fixed one with the other by the double cap <br>
6) The GMO are returned to the lab to be destroyed <br>


MATERIAL NEEDED : <br>
• 3D printer (one head is sufficient) <br>
• PLA or ABS filaments (both have been tested for this piece and worked) at least 0.7m long <br>
• File .stl of the whole double cap
